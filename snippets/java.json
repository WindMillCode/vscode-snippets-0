	// Place your snippets for java here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"generate testng test": {
		"prefix": "@Test",
		"body": [
			"@Test\npublic void $1() throws InterruptedException {\n$2\n}"
		],
		"description": "create a testng test"
	},
	"generate testng fluent method": {
		"prefix": "test",
		"body": [
			"public $1 $2()  {\n\treturn this$2\n}"
		],
		"description": "create a testng test"
	},
	"create testng fluent By":{
		"prefix":"public static By",
		"body":[
			"public static By $1(){\n\treturn By.$2($3);\n}"
		]
	}
}
